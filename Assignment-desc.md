###This Exercise is designed to test your data engineering skills.
1. Use any number of components of the SMACK Stack to parse the JSON data
of the Yelp data set (https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset)into a
tabular format, e.g. Cassandra or any other DB engine you find suitable for the
task. Write some interesting queries against the data to verify that everything
works.
2. Package your program as a Docker container (or multiple containers). The
script should take the path to the .tar file containing the Yelp data as a
parameter. Ideally you should also Dockerize the components of the SMACK
Stack you are using, but it is not strictly necessary.
Publish your code on GitHub, including a README, which explains how to
parse the data and execute your queries. Send the link to your GitHub
repository to jobs@newyorker.de once you have completed the exercise.
